This repository is part of the project:

ICU Risk Prediction Pipeline (MIMIC-IV)  
Main project page: https://github.com/makerjy/ICU-Risk-Prediction

## Position in Pipeline

Step: Validation (Model Structure Comparison)

Role in project:
- Compare different ML model structures under same data conditions
- Evaluate generalization beyond a single modeling pipeline
- Provide independent performance verification

Focus:
- Structural differences between ML models
- Robustness across feature configurations
